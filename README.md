Why?
Helping people learn how to code requires a simple but functional example.

Everyone has experience using a stopwatch. Whether to time an experiment in school (science class), cooking in the home or holding ones' breath under water, we can all immediately see the use of a stopwatch.

Yes, I hear you, "most mobile phones have stopwatches, why would anyone want to build their own?"
I agree, why "re-invent the wheel" if you already have a perfectly good one?

Well, as you are about to discover we are not re-inventing anything (yet!) simply discovering a few computer/web programming basics by building something we already know.

Once you have the basics mastered, you can unleash your imagination! :-)


How?
Open the index.html in your web browser and try the simple stopwatch. Then read the code in the files to understand how it all works!

I tried to simplify the UI as much as possible

While the stopwatch is running we have two actions: stop and reset

When we start after using stop button the stopwatch will resume from whatever time at which it was stopped.

After pressing reset whole timing will reset and become 00:00:00.

If you get stuck while reading the code or have any questions, please open an issue.
